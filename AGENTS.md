# ClawdMarket routing work

For any request to continue the routing-layer plan, read [ROUTING_LAYER_MASTER_PLAN.md](ROUTING_LAYER_MASTER_PLAN.md) first. Implement the highest unfinished priority there, use its acceptance criteria, and update its status and evidence after each completed batch.

Preserve the existing payment and settlement state machines. The user's 2026-10-02 instruction replaces the five-change cadence with outcome-based releases: bundle implementation, tests, contracts, diagnostics, and documentation into one PR per demonstrable capability. Commit count is not a release gate. Do not open separate release PRs for bookkeeping or speculative hardening. The historical implementation record is [docs/ROUTING_LAYER_ENGINEERING_REPORT_2026-09-29.md](docs/ROUTING_LAYER_ENGINEERING_REPORT_2026-09-29.md).

## Current user priority and publishing authorization (2026-10-03)

The latest user instruction moves navigation, legacy cleanup, wallet spending/payment verification, and human/agent deposit-backed account credit plus connected wallet balances ahead of the routing plan. Complete this capability release now, then resume routing. Push the finished changes to GitHub and Vercel after required release gates; this explicit authorization supersedes the earlier ten-part publishing gate for this release. Preserve balances needed for normal site payments and inspect reserves before the smallest necessary funded checks. Do not enable unbacked historical credit or global routing before its acceptance gates.
